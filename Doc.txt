Squares abstract class: PM
    fields:
    - Board board
    - int index
    - boolean singleSpace
    - ArrayList<Player> currentPlayers
    - String type

    methods:
    - isOccupied()
        returns true if occupied, false if free

    - getIndex()
        returns index of square as int

    - addPlayer(Player p)
        takes Player p and adds it to ArrayList<Player> currentPlayers

    - removePlayer(Player p)
        removes Player p from ArrayList<Player> currentPlayers

    - getType()
        returns string which indicates the type of the square

    - setType(String type)
        sets type of square to given string (Needs to be a valid type!)

    - moveAndLand(int distance, Player p)
        given an integer distance and Player p, this method calculates & returns the square the player will move to

    - requestLanding(Player p)
        abstract method which gets implemented by children. The reason for this is, that it differs quite a bit across
        the types of squares.


NormalSquare class PM
    fields:
    - inherits all fields from abstract class Squares

    methods:
    - inherits all methods from abstract class Squares

    - requestLanding(Player p)
        if it isn't occupied, it returns itself, else null (which the calling square understands as
        "couldn't land here")


FirstSquare class PM
    fields:
    - inherits all fields from abstract class Squares

    methods:
    - inherits all methods from abstract class Squares

    - requestLanding(Player p)
        always returns itself as there can be limitless players on the FirstSquare


LastSquare class PM
    fields:
        - inherits all fields from abstract class Squares

        methods:
        - inherits all methods from abstract class Squares

        - requestLanding(Player p)
            always returns itself (because it can only be occupied once, then the game ends, so no need to check whether
            there is already a player on it).
            tells the board that Player p won the game with setWinner(p)


LadderSquare class PM
    fields:
        - inherits all fields from abstract class Squares
        - int jumpDistance

        methods:
        - inherits all methods from abstract class Squares

        - constructor (... , int indexNext)
            initializes distance to targetSquare with own index and indexNext of next square

        - requestLanding(Player p)
            just passes on call to next square via call with jumpDistance and Player p


SnakeSquare class PM
    fields:
        - inherits all fields from abstract class Squares
        - int jumpDistance
        - Square squareTarget

        methods:
        - inherits all methods from abstract class Squares

        - constructor (... , int indexNext)
            initializes distance to targetSquare with own index and indexNext of next square

        - requestLanding(Player p)
            just passes on call to next square via call with jumpDistance and Player p
